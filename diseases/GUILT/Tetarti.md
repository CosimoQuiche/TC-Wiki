# Tetarti
**Tetarti** (Japanese: テタルティ, *tetaruti*) is the fourth strain of [GUILT](GUILT.md) encountered in *[Trauma Center: Under the Knife](../../games/utk/UTK.md)* and *[Trauma Center: Second Opinion](../../games/so/SO.md)*, and the second mutated GUILT strain in *[Trauma Center: Under the Knife 2](../../games/utk2/UTK2.md)*. They always appear in groups of three and release toxic antigens into their hosts. When first encountered, there is no available treatment, requiring research to be done on untreated Tetarti patients to extract antigen from immature Tetarti bodies to create a serum.

## <a id="General"></a>General
Tetarti is treated by injecting the correct colored serums into the corresponding Tetarti body with the [syringe](../../general/tools/Syringe.md). Any of the toxic diverticula it creates must also be injected with the correct serum, excised with the [scalpel](../../general/tools/Scalpel.md), and removed with the [forceps](../../general/tools/Forceps.md), leaving behind a hole that has to be covered by a membrane.

Immature Tetarti lack the visible color that mature Tetarti have and are only encountered in [*Race for the Cure*](../../games/so/episodes/4_2.md) in both *Under the Knife* and *Second Opinion*. While visible at the start of the operation, immature Tetarti have to be injected with a general serum to slow its activity. Afterwards, it will dive back into the organ, needing to be found with the [ultrasound](../../general/tools/Ultrasound.md) and brought to the surface with the scalpel. Once the immature Tetarti is incapacitated, it has to be dragged over to the tray with the forceps, sliced open with the scalpel, and then drained in order to obtain the antigen from its internal fluids.

Tetarti is mostly seen in the liver, stomach, and pancreas. It can also be seen in kidneys and lungs. Tetarti is stated<sup><a id="cite_ref_1"></a>[[1]](#cite_note-1)</sup> numerous<sup><a id="cite_ref_2"></a>[[2]](#cite_note-2)</sup> times<sup><a id="cite_ref_3"></a>[[3]](#cite_note-3)</sup> to be very contagious, so much so that special precautions need to be taken when operating for the first time.<sup><a id="cite_ref_4"></a>[[4]](#cite_note-4)</sup> Tetarti also affects the skin,<sup><a id="cite_ref_5"></a>[[5]](#cite_note-5)</sup> but what it does exactly isn't elaborated on.

## <a id="In_Under_the_Knife"></a>In *Under the Knife*
Tetarti in *Under the Knife* start out slow moving but will gain speed after each wave. Three toxic diverticula will be present upon entering the organ. These diverticula will release toxic antigen when grown to their full size. Initially, the colors will be difficult to see on the diverticula, but will gradually become more visible as they grow.

Three Tetarti are present on each wave, every wave. Upon appearing at the start of each wave, they will briefly show which colors they are before reverting back to a colorless state. From here, they must be injected with the serum corresponding to the color they were. They can only be injected while colorless. After some time, they will release a toxic antigen corresponding to their color. If all three the Tetarti are not injected in time, they will dive back into the organ, essentially resetting the wave.
Tetarti in *Under the Knife* move in a straight path, sometimes swaying from side to side and often turning around to avoid hitting the outer boundaries of the organ. If they hit the edge of the organ, or move in a way that would put them under the tool selection, they will bounce backwards and continue moving until something stops them. They will stop moving once injected with the correct color.

Tetarti’s primary way of dealing damage is from the antigen it emits. The toxic diverticula will also emit antigen once they reach their full size. Excising the diverticula also deals damage in a similar way to excising tumors. Injecting the incorrect color into a Tetarti body will create two diverticula, one at the one injected and another at the one with that color. The color of the diverticula corresponds to which Tetarti it spawned under. Additionally, due to Tetarti’s constant movement, the syringe missing will deal fair amounts of damage.

### <a id="Tips_UTK"></a>Tips
- Tetarti only require a very small amount of serum to incapacitate.
- If two Tetarti overlap, no matter which color is injected will likely result in a miss along with extra diverticula. Wait for the Tetarti bodies to move off of each other before injecting.

\*The patients in this operation are in randomized locations, no matter which area on the map is chosen. Only one of each type is required, but due to the randomization, can be up to five.

## <a id="In_Second_Opinion"></a>In *Second Opinion*
Tetarti in *Second Opinion* are slightly different from their *Under the Knife* counterparts. The speed they gain as the waves progress is more subtle, and there are much more waves. Three toxic diverticula will be present upon entering the organ. These diverticula will release toxic antigen when grown to their full size. Unlike in *Under the Knife*, the color of the diverticula are visible from the start.

Three Tetarti are present on each wave, every wave. Upon appearing at the start of each wave, they will briefly show which colors they are before reverting back to a colorless state. From here, they must be injected with the serum corresponding to the color they were. They can only be injected while colorless. After some time, they will release a toxic antigen corresponding to their color. If all three the Tetarti are not injected in time, they will dive back into the organ, essentially resetting the wave. 
In *6-3: Relapse* and *X4: Tetarti*, Tetarti will sometimes appear not showing their colors at all. The only way to tell their colors at this point is from the antigen they emit. These mutated Tetarti will also continue to move after being injected.
Tetarti in *Second Opinion* move in a straight path, often not stopping until they collide with something, but if allowed to go in one direction for long enough will change directions. Tetarti will bounce off organ boundaries and off invisible barrier if it might move in a way that would put it under a character portrait, the tool palette, a text box, or the vital meter. They will also bounce off other Tetarti, including ones that are currently incapacitated.

Tetarti’s primary way of dealing damage is from the antigen it emits, dealing more damage the higher the difficulty. The toxic diverticula will also emit antigen once they reach their full size. Excising these diverticula deals damage in a similar way to excising tumors. 
Injecting the incorrect color into a Tetarti body will create two diverticula, one under the incorrectly injected Tetarti and the other under the other color Tetarti. The color of the diverticula corresponds with the color of the Tetarti it spawned under. For the mutated Tetarti, injecting the incorrect color will only spawn one diverticula under the one that was injected. Additionally, due to Tetarti’s constant movement, the syringe missing will deal fair amounts of damage.

### <a id="Tips_SO"></a>Tips
- Tetarti only require a very small amount of serum to incapacitate.
- The [gel](../../general/tools/Antibiotic_Gel.md) can briefly stop any of the antigen Tetarti creates from dealing damage.
- Try to inject in front of the Tetarti, around its head and hands, to prevent misses.
- If the colors of Tetarti are difficult to see, particularly between yellow and green, try adjusting your screen’s contrast settings.

## <a id="In_Under_the_Knife_2"></a>In *Under the Knife 2*
Tetarti in *Under the Knife 2* are most mechanically similar to their *Under the Knife* counterparts, but visually similar to Tetarti in *Second Opinion*. They gain speed for every new wave and will start out relatively fast. Three toxic diverticula will be present upon entering the organ. These diverticula will release toxic antigen when grown to their full size. Unlike in *Under the Knife*, the color of the diverticula are visible from the start. *Under the Knife 2* introduces two new colors to Tetarti, being blue and black.

Three Tetarti are present on each wave, every wave. Upon appearing at the start of each wave, they will briefly show which colors they are before reverting back to a colorless state. From here, they must be injected with the serum corresponding to the color they were. They can only be injected while colorless. After some time, they will release a toxic antigen corresponding to their color. If all three the Tetarti are not injected in time, they will dive back into the organ, essentially resetting the wave. *5-2: Retaliation* introduces the color blue after the second wave, and *6-3: Widespread Fear* introduces black. Only three of the available colors will appear per wave. The mutated strain from *Second Opinion* that hides its colors is no longer present.

Tetarti’s primary way of dealing damage is from the antigen it emits, dealing more damage the higher the difficulty. The toxic diverticula will also emit antigen once they reach their full size. Excising these diverticula deals damage in a similar way to excising tumors. 
Injecting the incorrect color into a Tetarti body will create two diverticula, one under the incorrectly injected Tetarti and the other under the other color Tetarti. The color of the diverticula corresponds with the color of the Tetarti it spawned under.

### <a id="Tips_UTK2"></a>Tips
- Tetarti only require a very small amount of serum to incapacitate.
- The gel can briefly stop any of the antigen Tetarti creates from dealing damage.
- Tetarti will often get stuck in corners turning. This can be used against it, since it’s essentially standing still.

## <a id="Trivia"></a>Trivia
- Tetarti means “Wednesday” in Greek, a trait similar to all other GUILT strains.
- Tetarti has its name swapped with Triti in the Japanese versions of *Under the Knife*, *Second Opinion*, and *Under the Knife 2*.
- While the three different colors have names, which one is which changes depending on the order they’re done in in *Race for the Cure*. The V-type is the first, the P-type is the second, and the H-type is the third.
- No research is required for either of the new Tetarti strains in *Under the Knife 2*. The blue serum was synthesized from a patient treated at Caduceus who had a premature type of the mutation,<sup><a id="cite_ref_6"></a>[[6]](#cite_note-6)</sup> and the black serum from an antigen sample at a Delphi hideout.<sup><a id="cite_ref_7"></a>[[7]](#cite_note-7)</sup>
