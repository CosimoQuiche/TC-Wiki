# Deftera
**Deftera** (デフテラ *defutera*) is the second strain of [GUILT](GUILT.md) encountered in *[Trauma Center: Under the Knife](../../games/utk/UTK.md)* and *[Trauma Center: Second Opinion](../../games/so/SO.md)*. Deftera create tumors in the organs it affects. It always come in pairs, type A and type B. One is red, while the other is blue. It replicates its DNA quickly around the body, causing it to spread to multiple organs. This also creates the appearance of movement.<sup><a id="cite_ref_1"></a>[[1]](#cite_note-1)</sup> Deftera needs to be removed in it’s entirety in one go, or else it will just replicate itself again.<sup><a id="cite_ref_2"></a>[[2]](#cite_note-2)</sup>

## General
Deftera creates unique tumors in the patient’s organ that must be [lasered](../../general/tools/Laser.md). These tumors will create smaller tumors over time until it’s incinerated fully. Both of these types of tumors passively drop the patients vitals. When two opposite types of Deftera meet, they will merge into a single pair that must be drained three times in total. After the third drain, the pair will enter a rampaging state, dropping vitals fast while creating more tumors, needing to be excised with the [scalpel](../../general/tools/Scalpel.md) and removed with the [forceps](../../general/tools/Forceps.md), leaving behind a hole that has to be covered by a membrane. Any remaining tumors need to be treated before moving on.
In all operations, two pairs of Deftera will eventually be present. If two of the same type merge, they will bounce off each other, dealing damage to the patient and creating tumors. Additionally, a stray Deftera may bump into a merged pair, which will break apart the merged pair.

Known symptoms of Deftera include fading consciousness and significant pain.<sup><a id="cite_ref_3"></a>[[3]](#cite_note-3)</sup> If present in the lungs, it can cause respiratory distress.<sup><a id="cite_ref_4"></a>[[4]](#cite_note-4)</sup> It is implied to be capable of spreading all throughout the body, but is mainly operated on in the stomach and lungs.

## <a id="In_Under_the_Knife"></a>In *Under the Knife*
Deftera in *Under the Knife* are slow-moving bodies that move in a circular pattern around the organ. If they hit the edge of the organ, they will bounce off in another direction. It’s possible for them to never hit an organ boundary, making them circle until either [gelled](../../general/tools/Antibiotic_Gel.md) or hitting another Deftera. The red Deftera creates yellow tumors, while the blue Deftera creates purple tumors.

Deftera will occasionally make large, unique tumors that create smaller tumors around itself. They will continue to spawn tumors until fully incinerated. All patients infected with Deftera in *Under the Knife* have two organs that need to be operated on. In the first organ, one pair of Deftera is present. When the two opposite types meet, they will merge and turn into a tumor that needs to be drained. They have three phases, getting less saturated in color as their health drops. On the final phase after being drained, they will enter a rampaging state, rapidly spinning and dropping the vitals quickly while creating large tumors until they’re fully excised.
In the second organ, two pairs of Deftera will be present. When two pairs of Deftera are present, they can bump into each other. If two of the same type attempt to merge, they will bounce off each other, dealing damage to the patient and creating two large tumors. A single Deftera may also bump into a merged pair, breaking the pair and dealing damage along with creating a large tumor.

The damage caused by Deftera is primarily from the tumors it creates. The tumors will deal passive damage over time, stacking damage as more are created. Using the gel on a Deftera body will also slightly lower the vitals. If the Deftera bumps into either the same type or a merged pair, it will deal 3 damage. 

### <a id="Tips_UTK"></a>Tips
- Tapping the gel on one of the Deftera will make it bounce off, at the cost of some vitals. This can be used to stop Deftera from bumping into a merged pair, or to goad them to merge.
- Staying on top of tumors is a must, as they will deal significant amounts of damage if allowed to replicate exponentially.
- Keeping two pairs of Deftera on separate health can prevent them from merging with the same type, but will not prevent them from bumping into merged pairs.
- There is no need to boost vitals between organs, since the game treats it as a separate patient and resets the vitals to max.

## <a id="In_Second_Opinion"></a>In *Second Opinion*
Deftera in *Second Opinion* are fast-moving bodies that move in large circular patterns around the organ. If they hit the edge of the organ, they will bounce off in another direction. Unlike in *Under the Knife*, they can change direction mid-arc. The red Deftera creates yellow tumors, while the blue Deftera creates blue tumors.

Deftera will occasionally make large, unique tumors that create smaller tumors around itself. They will continue to spawn tumors until fully incinerated. All but one of the patients infected with Deftera in *Second Opinion* have two organs that need to be operated on. In the first organ, one pair of Deftera is present. When the two opposite types meet, they will merge and turn into a tumor that needs to be drained. They have three phases, getting more saturated in color as their health drops. On the final phase after being drained, they will enter a rampaging state, rapidly spinning and dropping the vitals quickly while creating large tumors until they’re fully excised.
When two pairs of Deftera are present, they can bump into each other. If two of the same type attempt to merge, they will bounce off each other, dealing damage to the patient and creating two large tumors. A single Deftera may also bump into a merged pair, breaking the pair and dealing damage along with creating a large tumor.

With *Second Opinion* introducing difficulty settings, Deftera will do more damage the higher the [difficulty](../../general/mechanics/Difficulty.md). The damage caused by Deftera is primarily from the tumors it creates, dealing more damage the more there are. Using the gel on a Deftera body will also slightly lower the vitals. If the Deftera bumps into either the same type or a merged pair, it will deal <font color="#584219">2</font color>/<font color="#848484">4</font color>/<font color="#C1A143">4</font color> damage, and 9 damage in [*X-2: Deftera*](../../games/so/episodes/X_2.md).

- Keeping two pairs of Deftera on separate health can prevent them from merging with the same type, but will not prevent them from bumping into merged pairs.
- In [*Fallen Heroes*](../../games/so/episodes/6_7.md) and *X-2: Deftera*, blood pools will spawn alongside Deftera. The blood pools can obscure Deftera and the tumors it creates, making them impossible to treat. Drain them as they appear.

## <a id="Trivia"></a>Trivia
- Deftera means “Monday” in Greek, a trait similar to all other GUILT strains.
- A [glitch exists in *Under the Knife*](../../games/utk/game/Glitches_in_Under_the_Knife.md) where a single Deftera will turn into a merged pair without the other. Trying to drain this "merged pair" will result in a crash.
- In *Under the Knife*, the second organ in Deftera operations is treated as an entirely separate patient. This was fixed in *Second Opinion*.
