# Triti
**Triti** (Japanese: トリーティ, *toriti*) is the third strain of [GUILT](GUILT.md) encountered in *[Trauma Center: Under the Knife](../../games/utk/UTK.md)* and *[Trauma Center: Second Opinion](../../games/so/SO.md)*. Triti is comprised of multiple triangular membranes covering an organ, which slowly petrify the affected organ. The points of the membranes are held in place with thorns. Triti was created from a failed cancer treatment from Caduceus Europe that Delphi had found out about.<sup><a id="cite_ref_1"></a>[[1]](#cite_note-1)</sup>

## General
Triti is primarily dealt with with the [forceps](../../general/tools/Forceps.md). To remove a membrane, the three thorns holding it in place need to be removed with the forceps, dragging them upward and onto the tray. These thorns may sometimes vaporize into a mist which then needs to be [drained](../../general/tools/Drain.md). Once the thorns holding a membrane in place are removed, the free membrane can be removed with the forceps. In *Under the Knife*, the membranes must be excised with the [scalpel](../../general/tools/Scalpel.md) first before removal.
Triti’s main gimmick is its ability to multiply. Every time a membrane is removed, Triti will multiply if certain conditions are met, such as if there are two adjacent thorns and an open space. If multiple spaces are open, then it will multiply to all possible spaces at once.

There are no directly stated symptoms of Triti aside from the membranes appearing in the affected organ. However, since it petrifies the organ, it can be assumed to cause organ failure if allowed to fully petrify the affected organ. Triti most commonly affects the pancreas, but has been rarely seen in the stomach.

## <a id="In_Under_the_Knife"></a>In *Under the Knife*
Triti in *Under the Knife* is comprised of multiple membranes arranged around the organ, connected and held in place by thorns. The thorns must be removed first, allowing membranes that no longer have thorns to be excised. Excised membranes can then be removed from the organ.

Triti will multiply when a membrane is removed and if certain conditions are met. If two adjacent thorns are present when a membrane is removed, Triti will multiply into that space once. It will do this on every applicable space. If a single membrane is left alone and that membrane regenerates a thorn, it will create a membrane on each of its three sides. Dropping a membrane when moving it to the tray will also cause the dropped membrane to fall back into the organ, multiplying around its sides since it regenerates thorns immediately. 
The thorns holding Triti in place must be removed by pulling them upwards first, then over to the tray. These thorns can vaporize into mist, requiring a brief drain. If the mist is allowed to roam around, the mist may turn into a membrane.

Triti will passively deal damage to the patient on a timer. The amount of damage it does depends on how many membranes there are, with more membranes dealing more damage. Occasionally, a single membrane will change color, going from its regular fleshy red to dark purple. These purple membranes deal damage independent of the other membranes, and the damage they deal is much higher. Only one membrane can be differently colored at a time.
<!-- someone should actually confirm the 'amount of membranes = amount of damage' thing -->

### <a id="Tips_UTK"></a>Tips
- Triti is very easily dealt with by using the [Healing Touch](../../general/Healing_Touch.md). With time slowed, all the thorns can be removed before Triti can regenerate them.
- Triti cannot extend past the organ boundaries, allowing for it to be cornered by letting it only multiply into one of the edges of the organ.
- Adjacent thorns pointing towards the organ boundaries can be left in while dealing with the rest of Triti, since it cannot multiply into that space.

## <a id="In_Second_Opinion"></a>In *Second Opinion*
Triti in *Second Opinion* is comprised of multiple membranes arranged around the organ, connected and held in place by thorns. The thorns must be removed first, allowing membranes that no longer have thorns to be removed. Unlike in *Under the Knife*, there is no excision step with the scalpel.

Triti will multiply when a membrane is removed and if certain conditions are met. If two adjacent thorns are present when a membrane is removed, Triti will multiply into that space once. It will do this on every applicable space. If a single membrane is left alone and that membrane regenerates a thorn, it will create a membrane on each of its three sides. Dropping a membrane when moving it to the tray will also cause the dropped membrane to fall back into the organ, multiplying around its sides since it regenerates thorns immediately. Triti cannot multiply outside of the boundaries of the organ, being limited to the shape of the organ it affects. 
The thorns holding Triti in place must be removed by pulling them upwards first, then over to the tray. These thorns can vaporize into mist, requiring a brief drain. If the mist is allowed to roam around, it may turn into a membrane.

Triti will passively deal damage to the patient on a timer. Unlike in *Under the Knife*, the individual green membranes do not deal damage over time. Instead, a single membrane will change color, going from its regular green to blue. These blue membranes deal damage independent of the other membranes, and the damage they deal is much higher. Only one membrane can be differently colored at a time. On higher difficulties, more damage is caused the blue membranes.

## <a id="Trivia"></a>Trivia
- Triti means “Tuesday” in Greek, a trait similar to all other GUILT strains.
- Triti has its name swapped with Tetarti in the Japanese versions of *Under the Knife*, *Second Opinion*, and *Under the Knife 2*.
- In *Under the Knife*, Triti is stated to be based on the [Tokyo subway sarin attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_subway_sarin_attack).<sup><a id="cite_ref_2"></a>[[2]](#cite_note-2)</sup> This line was removed in *Second Opinion*.
