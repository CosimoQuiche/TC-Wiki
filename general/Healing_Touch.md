# The Healing Touch

The **Healing Touch** (Japanese: 超執刀, *Super Sword* lit. *Super Surgery*) is a superhuman ability possessed by select doctors in the [Trauma Center Universe](Trauma_Center_Universe.md). It allows for the user to preform supernatural feats during surgery, at the expense of great physical strain. This allows doctors and surgeons the ability to treat people within an inch of death, or otherwise deemed 'incurable'. The Healing Touch manifests differently depending on the doctor. It can also notably be a great mental burden on doctors who have such an ability, as shown by [Dr. Hoffman](../games/so/characters/Robert_Hoffman.md), and later, [Derek Stiles](../games/so/characters/Derek_Stiles.md). It is also noted by [Greg Kasel](../games/so/characters/Greg_Kasel.md) that the Healing Touch cannot be a replacement for skill and practice.

## Origin 

In the English releases of both Under the Knife and Second Opinion, it is said by Robert Hoffman that the Healing Touch is supposedly passsed onto the descendants of Asclepius, the Greek God of Medicine. However, this is not the case in the original Japanese text. Naomi Kimishima often related her Healing Touch to her time in India.

The Healing Touch often manifests for a doctor due to an emergency that brings a patient close to death, as seen with Derek Stiles after a car accident, and Valerie Blaylock after a building collapse. 

It is also possible to lose the Healing Touch, most notably experienced by Derek Stiles in Under the Knife 2. This can likely be caused by physical intervention, or by a loss of faith in one's abilities. It is unknown if a doctor can permanently lose the Healing Touch once achieving it.

## Gameplay Functionality

Once the Healing Touch has been shown in the game, and/or practiced by the doctor with the ability, the Healing Touch becomes available for general use. In general, the Healing Touch can only be used once per in game operation, and only on one patient if operated on in quick succession. <!--It typically lasts around ?? seconds.--> In Trauma Center: New Blood, it is impossible to use two doctors' Healing Touches at the same during an operation in Co-op mode. However, in Second Opinion, both Naomi and Derek are shown using the Healing Touch together to save Dr. Hoffman.

## Types of Healing Touch

There are two major categories relating to the Healing Touch: those that affect time and speed, and those that affect the Vitals.

### Slowing Time

This type of Healing Touch involves the user thinking and moving at superhuman speed through intense concentration. This also requires an extreme amount of mental energy and focus which can be physically taxing at the extreme. Observers will note that the user appears to be moving extremely quick. This is shown to the player during Leo's operation recap in 4-4 in New Blood

In Under the Knife, this makes the Doctor move 2x faster, while in all other titles, it makes the doctor 4x faster.

### Vital Fixing

There are two major variants of this Healing Touch: Naomi Kimishima's and Valerie Blaylock's.

Naomi Kimishima's Healing Touch allows the player to boost the vitals through well done actions during an operation (typically via Cool actions, or through OKs).

Valerie Blaylock's Healing Touch locks the patient's vitals at their current value, essentially making the patient unable to improve or worsen. This means the Antibiotic Gel and Stabilizer will have no effect during the duration of her Healing Touch. The only way to influence the vitals during this period is for the patient to enter Cardiac Arrest.

### Other

Although it is discussed in game, it is unknown if Dr. Montgomery had a time altering Healing Touch, a Vitals related Healing Touch, or neither. Additionally, although Dr. Hoffman's Healing Touch is discussed in game, it is unknown if this is the same as Derek and Markus's Healing Touches, or if it manifests differently.

## Trivia

* It remains unknown if the Healing Touch is an innate ability, or if it can be learned.
	* Dr. Montgomery has collected notes relating to his experience with the Healing Touch, which Valerie Blaylock studied while positioned in Alaska.
* It is also unknown why most doctors with the ability to use the Healing Touch tend to imagine a star to invoke the ability 
* The only game where the Healing Touch isn't directly showcased is Trauma Team. However, it is referenced a few times.
	* The first reference is located in the XS dialogue following Chloe's Change, where Naomi muses that she didn't know a doctor "with the Hands of God" worked at Resurgam, in this case relating to Tomoe Tachibana.
	* The second is mostly speculation revolving Erhard's glowing hands before Naomi's operation in Twisted Rosalia. Some fan speculate he may have the healing touch due to this cutscene.
* It is unknown if the Healing Touch can manifest in other ways outside of surgery. Adel Tulba attempts to use it to injure Derek Stiles before his operation near the end of Under the Knife 2, meaning it is possible to use outside of surgery.
* As Valerie's Healing Touch essentially freezes the patient's condition, it could theoretically be detrimental to the patient if used during Cardiac Arrest, or another near death state.
