# Derek Stiles

Dr. **Derek Stiles** (Japanese: 月森孝介, *Tsukimori Kōsuke*) is the protagonist of *[Trauma Center: Under the Knife](../../utk/UTK.md)*, *[Trauma Center: Second Opinion](../SO.md)*, and *[Trauma Center: Under the Knife 2](../../utk2/UTK2.md)*. He is a genius, world-renowned surgeon, though can be rather bumbling at times. He is gifted with the [Healing Touch](../../../general/Healing_Touch.md), specifically being able to slow down time through superhuman concentration. Using his ability, as well as his determination and skill as a doctor, he worked at the forefront of the eradication of [GUILT](../../../diseases/GUILT.md), and continues to work on the behalf of [Caduceus International](../../../organizations/Caduceus_International.md).

## <a id="Early_Life"></a>Early Life
Derek grew up in the [Angeles Bay](../locations/Angeles_Bay.md) area, in a suburb called Northridge. He lost his father at a young age due to incurable disease, pushing him to become a doctor. Either shortly before or after this, he lost his family cat, [Tama](Tama.md), to a car accident as well.

In medical school, he became friends with [Tyler Chase](Tyler_Chase.md). He was described by Tyler as "[not] exactly an A student".<sup><a id="cite_ref_1.1"></a>[[1]](#cite_note-1)</sup>

Tyler initially thought Derek was "not adventurous enough" to join Caduceus, implying he has a more reserved temperament.<sup><a id="cite_ref_1.2"></a>[[1]](#cite_note-1)</sup>

## <a id="Trivia"></a>Trivia

* Derek's initials (DS) are a reference to the console he was released on, the [Nintendo DS](../../../general/hardware/Nintendo_DS.md).<sup><a id="cite_ref_2.1"></a>[[2]](#cite_note-2)</sup>
* His last name, Stiles, is also a pun for "stylus".<sup><a id="cite_ref_2.2"></a>[[2]](#cite_note-2)</sup>
* The suburb where Derek grew up is never directly shown in game. However, several unnamed suburbs are visited in both *Under the Knife*/*Second Opinion* and *Under the Knife 2*, one of which could be where he grew up.
* Due to localization differences between Japanese and North American versions of *Under the Knife*/*Second Opinion*, Derek works for Caduceus Japan throughout the entirety of the Japanese localization.
	* This difference is likely also the reason why he works for Caduceus Japan in *Trauma Center: New Blood*.
* Derek is the only character to fully appear in all 5 games in the series.
	* Angie also appears in some capacity in all games, but only appears in a hard to see photo in Derek's Office in *Trauma Team*.
* It is unknown how [Gabe](../../tt/characters/Gabriel_Cunningham.md) knows Derek personally. One possibility is that they know each other through their mutual friend, Naomi Kimishima.
