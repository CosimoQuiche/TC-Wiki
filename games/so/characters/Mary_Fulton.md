# Mary Fulton


**Mary Fulton** was a nurse at [Hope Hospital](../locations/Hope_Hospital.md), acting as one of [Derek Stiles’s](Derek_Stiles.md) key mentors, along with [Greg Kasel](Greg_Kasel.md), during the very beginning of [Under the Knife](../../utk/UTK.md) and [Second Opinion](../SO.md). She leaves after [1-4](../episodes/1_4.md), as her husband receives a different job position, and is replaced by [Angie](Angela_Thompson.md). She makes a returning appearance in [Trauma Center: Under the Knife 2](../../utk2/UTK2.md). 

## <a id="History"></a>History

Mary is a veteran nurse at Hope Hospital, seeming to have worked there well before Derek’s residency. She knows Derek very well, being able to tease him. She assists Derek in his [first](../episodes/1_1.md) [3](../episodes/1_2.md) [independent](../episodes/1_3.md) operations after his residency. She quickly leaves, however, by [1-4](../episodes/1_4.md), with her husband having found a new job in [San Diego](../locations/California.md#San_Diego).

## <a id="Appearance"></a>Appearance

Mary appears calm and well tempered throughout the games, and appears more collected and mature than her younger colleagues. In [Under the Knife](../../utk/UTK.md), she wears a pink nurses outfit. In [Second Opinion](../SO.md) and [Under the Knife 2](../../utk2/UTK2.md), she wears a white nurse’s outfit and has a mole on her right cheek.

## <a id="Personality"></a>Personality

Mary has a very likable personality, though she professes that she sometimes talks too much. She also enjoys teasing her colleagues during the games, revealing a more laid back aspect to her personality. She is, however, not afraid of taking charge of a situation, and demands only the best from her fellow doctors. Despite this, she offers unparalleled support in the operating theatre, as shown by her support of Derek Stiles during his [loss of faith in his skills](../../utk2/episodes/Chapter_4.md) as a surgeon.
