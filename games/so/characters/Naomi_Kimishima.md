# Naomi Kimishima

Dr. **Naomi Kimishima** (Japanese: ミラ キミシマ, *Mira Kimishima*) is the deuteragonist of *[Trauma Center: Second Opinion](../SO.md)*, and one of the six protagonists of *[Trauma Team](../../tt/TT.md)*. She is a master surgeon born in Okinawa, Japan, who later becomes a medical examiner in [Portland, Maine](../../tt/locations/Portland.md).

After losing her medical license in Japan, Naomi moves, with the help of [Delphi](../../../organizations/Delphi.md), to [Santa Balboa](../locations/Santa_Balboa.md). Under the pseudonym **Nozomi Weaver**, she is forced to assist Delphi with the use of her [Healing Touch](../../../general/Healing_Touch.md) in order to keep [GUILT](../../../diseases/GUILT.md) hosts alive for further testing. After the [collapse](../episodes/Z_5.md) of [Delphi's American Cell](../locations/Delphi's_American_Cell.md), she abandons Delphi and seeks amnesty with [Caduceus Europe](../../../organizations/Caduceus_Europe.md) with the help of several [Savato](../../../diseases/GUILT/Savato.md) samples.

Later on, after the events of *Second Opinion*, Naomi returns to the United States and is hired by the [Cumberland Institute of Forensic Medicine](../../tt/locations/CIFM.md) and works as a medical examiner, frequently collaborating with the [FBI](../../../organizations/FBI.md) on difficult cases.
