## <a id="Early_Life"></a>Early Life
Derek grew up in the Angeles Bay area, in a suburb called Northridge. He lost his father at a young age due to incurable disease, pushing him to become a doctor. Either shortly before or after this, he lost his family cat Tama to a car accident as well.

In medical school, he became friends with Tyler Chase. He was described by Tyler as "[not] exactly an A student".[^1]

Tyler initially thought Derek was "not adventurous enough" to join Caduceus, implying he has a more reserved temperament.[^1]

## <a id="Trivia"></a>Trivia

* Derek's initials (DS) are a reference to the console he was released on, the Nintendo DS.[^2]
* His last name, Stiles, is also a pun for "stylus".[^2]
* The suburb where Derek grew up is never directly shown in game. However, several unnamed suburbs are visited in both Second Opinion/Under the Knife and Under the Knife 2, one of which could be where he grew up.
* Due to localization differences between Japanese and North American UTK/SO, Derek works for Caduceus Japan throughout the entireity of the Japanese localization.
	* This difference is likely also the reason why he works for Caduceus Japan in Trauma Center: New Blood
* Derek is the only character to fully appear in all 5 games in the series.
	* Angie also appears in some capacity in all games, but only appears in a hard to see photo in Derek's Office in Trauma Team.
* It is unknown how Gabe knows Derek personally. One possibility is that they know each other through their mutual friend, Naomi Kimishima.
