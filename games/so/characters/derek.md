## <a id="Early_Life"></a>Early Life
Derek grew up in the Angeles Bay area, in a suburb called Northridge. He lost his father at a young age due to incurable disease, pushing him to become a doctor. Either shortly before or after this, he loses his family cat Tama to a car accident as well.

In medical school, he became friends with Tyler Chase. He was described by Tyler as "[not] exactly an A student".<sup><a id="cite_ref_1.1"></a>[[1]](#cite_note-1)</sup>

* Derek's initials (DS) are a reference to the console he was released on, the Nintendo DS.<sup><a id="cite_ref_2.1"></a>[[2]](#cite_note-2)</sup>
* His last name, Stiles, is also a pun for "stylus".<sup><a id="cite_ref_2.2"></a>[[2]](#cite_note-2)</sup>
* The suburb where Derek grew up is never directly shown in game. However, several unnamed suburbs are visited in both Second Opinion/Under the Knife and Under the Knife 2, one of which could be where he grew up.
* Due to localization differences between Japanese and North American UTK/SO, Derek works for Caduceus Japan throughout the entireity of the Japanese localization.
	* This difference is likely also the reason why he works for Caduceus Japan in Trauma Center: New Blood
