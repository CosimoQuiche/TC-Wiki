# Glitches in Second Opinion

**Glitches in Second Opinion** are mostly minor, and visual in nature. [Second Opinion](../SO.md) was a launch title for the [Nintendo Wii](../../../general/hardware/Wii.md), so it contains numerous quirks related to the Wii's launch.

## Buffered Operation Success Dialogue

If one exits an operation, or restarts it one frame before the "Operation Success" dialogue box appears, then the operation success box will appear over either the briefing, or over the [Episode Select Screen](Episode_Select_Screen.md). This will also stop the [briefing music](../soundtrack/4-Operation_Briefing.md).

## Buffered Sutures/Stars

Sometimes 'ghost' [sutures](../../../general/tools/sutures.md) or [stars](../../../general/Healing_Touch.md) will appear when beginning an op, depending on your actions on your last preformed op. This can carry between save files.

## Black Kyriaki

Rarely, a graphical glitch can occur with [Kyriaki](../../../diseases/GUILT/Kyriaki.md) where the model appears black. The cause is unknown

## Web Skip

*See Also: [Savato | Web Skip](../../../diseases/GUILT/Savato.md#Web_Skip)*

Due to a glitch, tools can be used for one frame when they are at 0 durability if the [Z button](../../../general/hardware/Wiimote.md) is tapped repeatedly to act as if one is activating the [Healing Touch](../../../general/Healing_Touch.md). This has one major practical application, where [Savato's](../../../diseases/GUILT/Savato.md) webs can be cut much earlier than intended, making the web phase much easier to complete.

## Pempti Skip

Rarely, the final animation for [Pempti's](../../../diseases/GUILT/Savato.md) death can end early. This happens extraordinarily rarely, though tends to happen most often on [X-5](../episodes/X_5.md). The cause is currently unknown. This skip can assist [speedruns](../../../community/speedrunning/SO_Speedruning.md), though it appears to be impossible to consistently replicate.

## ESS (Episode Select Skip)

After completing an operation, or during a story only operation, it is possible to exit out of the episode early, allowing for an op to be completed without reading all its dialogue. It is unknown if this behavior is intentional or not, thus this may not be a glitch. This trick is used often in speedruns.
