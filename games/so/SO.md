Dr. Weaver also possesses the ability to utilize the mysterious [Healing Touch](../general/Healing_Touch.md), albeit in a different manner to Derek. The game features two new chapters, [Chapter Z](episodes/Chapter_Z.md) and a new, revamped [Chapter 6](episodes/Chapter_6.md).

## <a id="Plot"></a>Plot
*See Also: [Episode List for Trauma Center: Second Opinion](episodes/Episode_List.md) and [Plot of Trauma Center: Under the Knife](../utk/UTK.md#Plot)*

The plot between Second Opinion and Under the Knife remain almost entirely unchanged between Chapters 1 through 5. Second Opinion, however, introduces two new chapters to the story, namely Chapter Z and a new Chapter 6, with Under the Knife's Chapter 6 being summarized in [6-1](episodes/6_1.md).

[Chapter Z](episodes/Chapter_Z.md) introduces [Dr. Nozomi Weaver](characters/Naomi_Kimishima.md), a doctor on an exchange program with [St. Francis Hospital](locations/St_Francis_Hospital.md) in [Santa Balboa](locations/Santa_Balboa.md). The events run parallel to the main storyline, and reveal Dr. Weaver's true identity as a member of the bioterrorist group, [Delphi](../../organizations/Delphi.md), treating patients that are infected with [GUILT](../../diseases/GUILT/GUILT.md) to advance Delphi's research. It also reveals her connections to [Professor Blackwell](characters/Kennith_Blackwell.md), and introduces [Navel](characters/Little_Guy.md) as a character, acting as her liaison with Delphi. This chapter's storyline culminates in the [raid](episodes/Z_5.md) on [Delphi's American Cell](locations/Delphi's_American_Cell.md), where Naomi and Blackwell discover [Savato](../../diseases/GUILT/Savato.md) in a patient's Small Intestine. After this operation, she, along with Navel, are released from their obligations with Delphi, where Naomi then uses her Savato samples as a bargaining token with [Caduceus Europe](locations/Caduceus_Europe.md).

[Chapter 6](episodes/Chapter_6.md) takes place after the events of Under the Knife, and begins with an invitation for doctors from Caduceus USA to attend a medical conference hosted by Caduceus Europe in the aftermath of the takedown of [Delphi's Pacific Cell](../utk/locations/Delphi's_Pacific_Cell.md). This also revolves around latent GUILT infections present throughout Europe after the fall of Delphi. Derek and Angie accept the invitation on the behalf of Caduceus USA, with [Director Hoffman](characters/Robert_Hoffman) arriving later for the conference. During their time in Europe, Derek meets again with [Director Miller](), and meets Naomi Kimishima for the first time. After an [unusual Tetarti operation](episodes/6_3.md), Derek collapses, and is quickly confirmed to be infected with two strains of GUILT. Naomi then operates with Angie's assistance to [save Derek's life](episodes/6_4.md). Director Miller then reveals to Derek the true nature of Caduceus Europe's new research; namely that it is derived from [cells](../../diseases/GUILT/Z_Cells.md) from [Adam's](characters/Adam.md) body.

## <a id="Gameplay"></a>Gameplay

The controls for Second Opinion were entirely revamped after Under the Knife, as the series transitioned from the [Nintendo DS](../../general/hardware/Nintendo_DS.md) to the [Wii](../../general/hardware/Wii.md). Tool selection is now down with the [nunchuck's joystick](../../general/hardware/Wiimote.md), allowing for a more seamless playstyle. The pointer is operated by the Wiimote's IR motion sensor, integrating motion controls in the game's playstyle. The [menu system](game/Episode_Select.md) was also entirely reworked from Under the Knife, providing for multiple [difficulty](../../general/Difficulty.md) options and an easier way to replay operations and their cutscenes. All sprites and textures were also reworked, using a more abstract style than Under the Knife. The game also features an autosave system, as well as introduces the famous [XS rank](../../general/Ranks.md).
